# What-is-AMH-and-why-is-it-important-in-IVF-treatment-

AMH means Anti-MÃ¼llerian Hormone. It tells how many eggs you have left in your ovaries â€“ this is called your ovarian reserve.

If AMH is high (above 2), it means you have good number of eggs. If AMH is very low (less than 1), IVF becomes more difficult because fewer eggs will grow.

AMH test helps the doctor decide how much hormone dose you need for IVF and what is your success chance.

Itâ€™s a simple blood test, but very important before starting IVF. Women with low AMH should not wait too long.

At Ayuh Fertility Centre, AMH is checked as part of first tests. Based on that, Dr. Krupa Shah creates a special IVF plan for you.
